"This example plots horizontal histograms of different samples along a "
"categorical x-axis. Additionally, the histograms are plotted to be "
"symmetrical about their x-position, thus making them very similar to "
"violin plots."

"To make this highly specialized plot, we can't use the standard ``hist`` "
"method. Instead we use ``barh`` to draw the horizontal bars directly. The"
" vertical positions and lengths of the bars are computed via the "
"``np.histogram`` function. The histograms for all the samples are "
"computed using the same range (min and max values) and number of bins, so"
" that the bins for each sample are in the same vertical positions."

"Selecting different bin counts and sizes can significantly affect the "
"shape of a histogram. The Astropy docs have a great section on how to "
"select these parameters: "
