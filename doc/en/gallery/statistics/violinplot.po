"Violin plots are similar to histograms and box plots in that they show an"
" abstract representation of the probability distribution of the sample. "
"Rather than showing counts of data points that fall into bins or order "
"statistics, violin plots use kernel density estimation (KDE) to compute "
"an empirical distribution of the sample. That computation is controlled "
"by several parameters. This example demonstrates how to modify the number"
" of points at which the KDE is evaluated (``points``) and how to modify "
"the band-width of the KDE (``bw_method``)."
