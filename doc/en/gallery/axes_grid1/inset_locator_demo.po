"The `.inset_locator`'s `~.inset_locator.inset_axes` allows easily placing"
" insets in the corners of the axes by specifying a width and height and "
"optionally a location (loc) that accepts locations as codes, similar to "
"`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.legend`. By default, the inset is offset by some "
"points from the axes, controlled via the *borderpad* parameter."

"The parameters *bbox_to_anchor* and *bbox_transform* can be used for a "
"more fine grained control over the inset position and size or even to "
"position the inset at completely arbitrary positions. The "
"*bbox_to_anchor* sets the bounding box in coordinates according to the "
"*bbox_transform*."

"In the above the axes transform together with 4-tuple bounding boxes has "
"been used as it mostly is useful to specify an inset relative to the axes"
" it is an inset to. However other use cases are equally possible. The "
"following example examines some of those."
