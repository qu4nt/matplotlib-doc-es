"When decorating axes with text boxes, two useful tricks are to place the "
"text in axes coordinates (see "
":doc:`/tutorials/advanced/transforms_tutorial`), so the text doesn't move"
" around with changes in x or y limits.  You can also use the ``bbox`` "
"property of text to surround the text with a `~matplotlib.patches.Patch` "
"instance -- the ``bbox`` keyword argument takes a dictionary with keys "
"that are Patch properties."
