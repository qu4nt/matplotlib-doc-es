"Text objects in matplotlib are normally rotated with respect to the "
"screen coordinate system (i.e., 45 degrees rotation plots text along a "
"line that is in between horizontal and vertical no matter how the axes "
"are changed).  However, at times one wants to rotate text with respect to"
" something on the plot.  In this case, the correct angle won't be the "
"angle of that object in the plot coordinate system, but the angle that "
"that object APPEARS in the screen coordinate system.  This angle can be "
"determined automatically by setting the parameter "
"*transform_rotates_text*, as shown in the example below."
