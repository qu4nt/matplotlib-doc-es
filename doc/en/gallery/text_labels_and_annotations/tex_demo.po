"You can use TeX to render all of your Matplotlib text by setting "
":rc:`text.usetex` to True.  This requires that you have TeX and the other"
" dependencies described in the :doc:`/tutorials/text/usetex` tutorial "
"properly installed on your system.  Matplotlib caches processed TeX "
"expressions, so that only the first occurrence of an expression triggers "
"a TeX compilation. Later occurrences reuse the rendered image from the "
"cache and are thus faster."
