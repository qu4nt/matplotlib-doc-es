"The text is aligned by its bounding box (the rectangular box that "
"surrounds the ink rectangle).  The order of operations is rotation then "
"alignment. Basically, the text is centered at your (x, y) location, "
"rotated around this point, and then aligned according to the bounding box"
" of the rotated text."
