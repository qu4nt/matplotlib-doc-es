"The matplotlib backend lets us assign ids to each object. This is the "
"mechanism used here to relate matplotlib objects created in python and "
"the corresponding SVG constructs that are parsed in the second step. "
"While flexible, ids are cumbersome to use for large collection of "
"objects. Two mechanisms could be used to simplify things:"
