"When using Matplotlib in a web server it is strongly recommended to not "
"use pyplot (pyplot maintains references to the opened figures to make "
"`~.matplotlib.pyplot.show` work, but this will cause memory leaks unless "

" constructor and save them to in-memory buffers.  In older versions, it "
"was necessary to explicitly instantiate an Agg canvas (see e.g. "
":doc:`/gallery/user_interfaces/canvasagg`)."
