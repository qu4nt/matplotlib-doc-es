"This example shows how to use the agg backend directly to create images, "
"which may be of use to web application developers who want full control "
"over their code without using the pyplot interface to manage figures, "
"figure closing etc."

"It is not necessary to avoid using the pyplot interface in order to "
"create figures without a graphical front-end - simply setting the backend"
" to \"Agg\" would be sufficient."

"In this example, we show how to save the contents of the agg canvas to a "
"file, and how to extract them to a numpy array, which can in turn be "
"passed off to Pillow_.  The latter functionality allows e.g. to use "
"Matplotlib inside a cgi-script *without* needing to write a figure to "
"disk, and to write images in any format supported by Pillow."
