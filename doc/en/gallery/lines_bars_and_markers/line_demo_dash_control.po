"The dashing of a line is controlled via a dash sequence. It can be "
"modified using `.Line2D.set_dashes`."

"The dash sequence is a series of on/off lengths in points, e.g. ``[3, "
"1]`` would be 3pt long lines separated by 1pt spaces."

"Some functions like `.Axes.plot` support passing Line properties as "
"keyword arguments. In such a case, you can already set the dashing when "
"creating the line."

"*Note*: The dash style can also be configured via a :doc:`property_cycle "
"</tutorials/intermediate/color_cycle>` by passing a list of dash "
"sequences using the keyword *dashes* to the cycler. This is not shown "
"within this example."
