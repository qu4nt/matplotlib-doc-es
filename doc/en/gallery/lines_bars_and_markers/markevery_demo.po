"Integer arguments are fairly intuitive.  e.g. ``markevery=5`` will plot "
"every 5th marker starting from the first data point."

"Float arguments allow markers to be spaced at approximately equal "
"distances along the line.  The theoretical distance along the line "
"between markers is determined by multiplying the display-coordinate "
"distance of the axes bounding-box diagonal by the value of ``markevery``."
"  The data points closest to the theoretical distances will be shown."
