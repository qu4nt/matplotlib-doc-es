"The `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.fill_between` function generates a shaded "
"region between a min and max boundary that is useful for illustrating "
"ranges. It has a very handy ``where`` argument to combine filling with "
"logical ranges, e.g., to just fill in a curve over some threshold value."

"At its most basic level, ``fill_between`` can be use to enhance a graphs "
"visual appearance. Let's compare two graphs of a financial times with a "
"simple line plot on the left and a filled line on the right."

"The alpha channel is not necessary here, but it can be used to soften "
"colors for more visually appealing plots.  In other examples, as we'll "
"see below, the alpha channel is functionally useful as the shaded regions"
" can overlap and alpha allows you to see both.  Note that the postscript "
"format does not support alpha (this is a postscript limitation, not a "
"matplotlib limitation), so when using alpha save your figures in PNG, PDF"
" or SVG."

"Our next example computes two populations of random walkers with a "
"different mean and standard deviation of the normal distributions from "
"which the steps are drawn.  We use filled regions to plot +/- one "
"standard deviation of the mean position of the population.  Here the "
"alpha channel is useful, not just aesthetic."

"The ``where`` keyword argument is very handy for highlighting certain "
"regions of the graph.  ``where`` takes a boolean mask the same length as "
"the x, ymin and ymax arguments, and only fills in the region where the "
"boolean mask is True.  In the example below, we simulate a single random "
"walker and compute the analytic mean and standard deviation of the "
"population positions.  The population mean is shown as the dashed line, "
"and the plus/minus one sigma deviation from the mean is shown as the "
"filled region.  We use the where mask ``X > upper_bound`` to find the "
"region where the walker is outside the one sigma boundary, and shade that"
" region red."

"Another handy use of filled regions is to highlight horizontal or "
"vertical spans of an axes -- for that Matplotlib has the helper functions"
" `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.axhspan` and `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.axvspan`.  "
"See :doc:`/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/axhspan_demo`."
