"Demonstration of a stem plot in 3D, which plots vertical lines from a "

"The position of the baseline can be adapted using *bottom*. The "
"parameters *linefmt*, *markerfmt*, and *basefmt* control basic format "
"properties of the plot. However, in contrast to `~.axes3d.Axes3D.plot` "
"not all properties are configurable via keyword arguments. For more "
"advanced control adapt the line objects returned by `.stem3D`."

"For examples, by setting ``orientation='x'``, the stems are projected "
