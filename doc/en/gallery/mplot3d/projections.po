"Demonstrates the different camera projections for 3D plots, and the "
"effects of changing the focal length for a perspective projection. Note "
"that Matplotlib corrects for the 'zoom' effect of changing the focal "
"length."

"The default focal length of 1 corresponds to a Field of View (FOV) of 90 "
"deg. An increased focal length between 1 and infinity \"flattens\" the "
"image, while a decreased focal length between 1 and 0 exaggerates the "
"perspective and gives the image more apparent depth. In the limiting "
"case, a focal length of infinity corresponds to an orthographic "
"projection after correction of the zoom effect."
