"To animate the histogram, we need an ``animate`` function, which "
"generates a random set of numbers and updates the heights of rectangles. "
"We utilize a python closure to track an instance of `.BarContainer` whose"

"Using :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.hist` allows us to get an instance of "

" ``prepare_animation`` will define ``animate`` function working with "
"supplied `.BarContainer`, all this is used to setup `.FuncAnimation`."
