"Note that the \"overlay\" and \"soft\" blend modes work well for complex "
"surfaces such as this example, while the default \"hsv\" blend mode works"
" best for smooth surfaces such as many mathematical functions."

"In most cases, hillshading is used purely for visual purposes, and "
"*dx*/*dy* can be safely ignored. In that case, you can tweak *vert_exag* "
"(vertical exaggeration) by trial and error to give the desired visual "
"effect. However, this example demonstrates how to use the *dx* and *dy* "
"keyword arguments to ensure that the *vert_exag* parameter is the true "
"vertical exaggeration."
