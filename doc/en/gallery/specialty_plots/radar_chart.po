"Although this example allows a frame of either 'circle' or 'polygon', "
"polygon frames don't have proper gridlines (the lines are circles instead"
" of polygons). It's possible to get a polygon grid by setting "
"GRIDLINE_INTERPOLATION_STEPS in matplotlib.axis to the desired number of "
"vertices, but the orientation of the polygon is not aligned with the "
"radial axes."
