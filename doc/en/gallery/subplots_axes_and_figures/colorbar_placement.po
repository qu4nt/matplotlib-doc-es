"The first column has the same type of data in both rows, so it may be "
"desirable to combine the colorbar which we do by calling "
"`.Figure.colorbar` with a list of axes instead of a single axes."

"Placing colorbars for axes with a fixed aspect ratio pose a particular "
"challenge as the parent axes changes size depending on the data view."

"One way around this issue is to use an `.Axes.inset_axes` to locate the "
"axes in axes coordinates.  Note that if you zoom in on the axes, and "
"change the shape of the axes, the colorbar will also change position."
