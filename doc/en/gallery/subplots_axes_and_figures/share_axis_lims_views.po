"It's common to make two or more plots which share an axis, e.g., two "
"subplots with time as a common axis.  When you pan and zoom around on "
"one, you want the other to move around with you.  To facilitate this, "
"matplotlib Axes support a ``sharex`` and ``sharey`` attribute.  When you "
"create a `~.pyplot.subplot` or `~.pyplot.axes`, you can pass in a keyword"
" indicating what axes you want to share with."
