"`matplotlib.pyplot` uses the concept of a *current figure* and *current "
"axes*. Figures are identified via a figure number that is passed to "
"`~.pyplot.figure`. The figure with the given number is set as *current "
"figure*. Additionally, if no figure with the number exists, a new one is "
"created."

"We discourage working with multiple figures in pyplot because managing "
"the *current figure* is cumbersome and error-prone. Instead, we recommend"
" to use the object-oriented approach and call methods on Figure and Axes "
"instances."
