"Changing the axis limits on one axes will be reflected automatically in "
"the other, and vice-versa, so when you navigate with the toolbar the axes"
" will follow each other on their shared axes.  Ditto for changes in the "
"axis scaling (e.g., log vs. linear).  However, it is possible to have "
"differences in tick labeling, e.g., you can selectively turn off the tick"
" labels on one axes."

"The example below shows how to customize the tick labels on the various "
"axes.  Shared axes share the tick locator, tick formatter, view limits, "
"and transformation (e.g., log, linear).  But the ticklabels themselves do"
" not share properties.  This is a feature and not a bug, because you may "
"want to make the tick labels smaller on the upper axes, e.g., in the "
"example below."
