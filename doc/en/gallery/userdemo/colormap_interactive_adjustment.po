"Demonstration of how a colorbar can be used to interactively adjust the "
"range of colormapping on an image. To use the interactive feature, you "
"must be in either zoom mode (magnifying glass toolbar button) or pan mode"
" (4-way arrow toolbar button) and click inside the colorbar."

"When zooming, the bounding box of the zoom region defines the new vmin "
"and vmax of the norm. Zooming using the right mouse button will expand "
"the vmin and vmax proportionally to the selected region, in the same "
"manner that one can zoom out on an axis. When panning, the vmin and vmax "
"of the norm are both shifted according to the direction of movement. The "
"Home/Back/Forward buttons can also be used to get back to a previous "
"state."
