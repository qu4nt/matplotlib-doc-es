"Notice how in this example, *par1* and *par2* are both obtained by "
"calling ``twinx()``, which ties their x-limits with the host's x-axis. "
"From there, each of those two axis behave separately from each other: "
"different datasets can be plotted, and the y-limits are adjusted "
"separately."

"Note that this approach uses the `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.parasite_axes`'"
" `~mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.parasite_axes.host_subplot` and "
"`mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axislines.Axes`. An alternative approach using "

"`~.mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.parasite_axes.HostAxes` and "
"`~.mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.parasite_axes.ParasiteAxes` is the "
