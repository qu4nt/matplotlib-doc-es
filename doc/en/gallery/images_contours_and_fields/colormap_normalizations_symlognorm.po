"Synthetic dataset consisting of two humps, one negative and one positive,"
" the positive with 8-times the amplitude. Linearly, the negative hump is "
"almost invisible, and it is very difficult to see any detail of its "
"profile. With the logarithmic scaling applied to both positive and "
"negative values, it is much easier to see the shape of each hump."

"In order to find the best visualization for any particular dataset, it "
"may be necessary to experiment with multiple different color scales. As "
"well as the `~.colors.SymLogNorm` scaling, there is also the option of "
"using `~.colors.AsinhNorm` (experimental), which has a smoother "
"transition between the linear and logarithmic regions of the "
"transformation applied to the data values, \"Z\". In the plots below, it "
"may be possible to see contour-like artifacts around each hump despite "
"there being no sharp features in the dataset itself. The ``asinh`` "
"scaling shows a smoother shading of each hump."
