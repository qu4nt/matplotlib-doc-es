"When plotting daily data, a frequent request is to plot the data ignoring"
" skips, e.g., no extra spaces for weekends.  This is particularly common "
"in financial time series, when you may have data for M-F and not Sat, Sun"
" and you don't want gaps in the x axis.  The approach is to simply use "
"the integer index for the xdata and a custom tick Formatter to get the "
"appropriate date string for a given index."
