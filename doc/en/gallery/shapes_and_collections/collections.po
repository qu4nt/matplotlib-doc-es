"For the first two subplots, we will use spirals.  Their size will be set "
"in plot units, not data units.  Their positions will be set in data units"

"The last subplot illustrates the use of \"offsets=(xo, yo)\", that is, a "
"single tuple instead of a list of tuples, to generate successively offset"
" curves, with the offset given in data units.  This behavior is available"
