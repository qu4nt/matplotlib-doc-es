"As discussed at length elsewhere [insert links], ``jet`` is an "
"empirically bad colormap and should not be the default colormap. Due to "
"the position that changing the appearance of the plot breaks backward "
"compatibility, this change has been put off for far longer than it should"
" have been.  In addition to changing the default color map we plan to "
"take the chance to change the default color-cycle on plots and to adopt a"
" different colormap for filled plots (``imshow``, ``pcolor``, "
"``contourf``, etc) and for scatter like plots."

"The choice of a new colormap is fertile ground to bike-shedding (\"No, it"

"Nathaniel Smith) to evaluate proposed colormaps."

"it should be a sequential colormap, because diverging colormaps are "
"really misleading unless you know where the \"center\" of the data is, "
"and for a default colormap we generally won't."

"it should be perceptually uniform, i.e., human subjective judgments of "
"how far apart nearby colors are should correspond as linearly as possible"
" to the difference between the numerical values they represent, at least "
"locally."

"it should have a perceptually uniform luminance ramp, i.e. if you convert"
" to greyscale it should still be uniform. This is useful both in "
"practical terms (greyscale printers are still a thing!) and because "
"luminance is a very strong and natural cue to magnitude."

"it should also have some kind of variation in hue, because hue variation "
"is a really helpful additional cue to perception, having two cues is "

"the hue variation should be chosen to produce reasonable results even for"
" viewers with the more common types of colorblindness. (Which rules out "
"things like red-to-green.)"

"For bonus points, it would be nice to choose a hue ramp that still works "
"if you throw away the luminance variation, because then we could use the "
"version with varying luminance for 2d plots, and the version with just "
"hue variation for 3d plots. (In 3d plots you really want to reserve the "
"luminance channel for lighting/shading, because your brain is *really* "
"good at extracting 3d shape from luminance variation. If the 3d surface "
"itself has massively varying luminance then this screws up the ability to"
" see shape.)"

"For heat-map like applications it can be desirable to cover as much of "
"the luminance scale as possible, however when colormapping markers, "
"having markers too close to white can be a problem.  For that reason we "
"propose using a different (but maybe related) colormap to the heat map "
"for marker-based.  The design parameters are the same as above, only with"
" a more limited luminance variation."
