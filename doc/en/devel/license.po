"Matplotlib only uses BSD compatible code.  If you bring in code from "
"another project make sure it has a PSF, BSD, MIT or compatible license "
"(see the Open Source Initiative `licenses page "
"<https://opensource.org/licenses>`_ for details on individual licenses)."
"  If it doesn't, you may consider contacting the author and asking them "
"to relicense it.  GPL and LGPL code are not acceptable in the main code "
"base, though we are considering an alternative way of distributing L/GPL "
"code through an separate channel, possibly a toolkit.  If you include "
"code, make sure you include a copy of that code's license in the license "
"directory if the code's license requires you to distribute the license "
"with it.  Non-BSD compatible licenses are acceptable in Matplotlib "
"toolkits (e.g., basemap), but make sure you clearly state the licenses "
"you are using."

"The two dominant license variants in the wild are GPL-style and BSD-"
"style. There are countless other licenses that place specific "
"restrictions on code reuse, but there is an important difference to be "
"considered in the GPL and BSD variants.  The best known and perhaps most "
"widely used license is the GPL, which in addition to granting you full "
"rights to the source code including redistribution, carries with it an "
"extra obligation. If you use GPL code in your own code, or link with it, "
"your product must be released under a GPL compatible license. i.e., you "
"are required to give the source code to other people and give them the "
"right to redistribute it as well. Many of the most famous and widely used"
" open source projects are released under the GPL, including linux, gcc, "
"emacs and sage."

"The second major class are the BSD-style licenses (which includes MIT and"
" the python PSF license). These basically allow you to do whatever you "
"want with the code: ignore it, include it in your own open source "
"project, include it in your proprietary product, sell it, whatever. "
"python itself is released under a BSD compatible license, in the sense "
"that, quoting from the PSF license page::"

"There are several reasons why early Matplotlib developers selected a BSD "
"compatible license. Matplotlib is a python extension, and we choose a "
"license that was based on the python license (BSD compatible).  Also, we "
"wanted to attract as many users and developers as possible, and many "
"software companies will not use GPL code in software they plan to "
"distribute, even those that are highly committed to open source "
"development, such as `enthought <https://www.enthought.com>`_, out of "
"legitimate concern that use of the GPL will \"infect\" their code base by"
" its viral nature. In effect, they want to retain the right to release "
"some proprietary code. Companies and institutions who use Matplotlib "
"often make significant contributions, because they have the resources to "
"get a job done, even a boring one. Two of the Matplotlib backends (FLTK "
"and WX) were contributed by private companies.  The final reason behind "
"the licensing choice is compatibility with the other python extensions "
"for scientific computing: ipython, numpy, scipy, the enthought tool suite"
" and python itself are all distributed under BSD compatible licenses."
