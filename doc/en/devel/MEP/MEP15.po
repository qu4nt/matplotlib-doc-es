"When one Axis of a 2-dimensional plot is overridden via `~.Axes.set_xlim`"
" or `~.Axes.set_ylim`, automatic scaling of the remaining Axis should be "
"based on the data that falls within the specified limits of the first "
"Axis."

"When axis limits for a 2-D plot are specified for one axis only (via "
"`~.Axes.set_xlim` or `~.Axes.set_ylim`), matplotlib currently does not "
"currently rescale the other axis.  The result is that the displayed "
"curves or symbols may be compressed into a tiny portion of the available "
"area, so that the final plot conveys much less information than it would "
"with appropriate axis scaling."

"The proposed change of behavior would make matplotlib choose the scale "
"for the remaining axis using only the data that falls within the limits "
"for the axis where limits were specified."

"backward compatibility.  Some outputs would be different, but if the user"
" truly desires the previous behavior, he/she can achieve this by "
