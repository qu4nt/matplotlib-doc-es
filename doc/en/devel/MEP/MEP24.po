"One obvious application that we should support is bB plots (see "
"https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1730#issuecomment-40815837),"
" but this seems more generally useful (for example growth rate as a "
"function of angle).  The assumption in the current code (as I understand "
"it) is that the center of the graph is ``r==0``, however it would be good"
" to be able to set the center to be at any ``r`` (with any value less "
"than the offset clipped)."
