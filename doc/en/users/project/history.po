"Matplotlib is a library for making 2D plots of arrays in `Python "
"<https://www.python.org>`_.  Although it has its origins in emulating the"
" MATLAB graphics commands, it is independent of MATLAB, and can be used "
"in a Pythonic, object oriented way.  Although Matplotlib is written "
"primarily in pure Python, it makes heavy use of `NumPy "
"<https://numpy.org>`_ and other extension code to provide good "
"performance even for large arrays."

"Matplotlib is designed with the philosophy that you should be able to "
"create simple plots with just a few commands, or just one!  If you want "
"to see a histogram of your data, you shouldn't need to instantiate "
"objects, call methods, set properties, and so on; it should just work."

"For years, I used to use MATLAB exclusively for data analysis and "
"visualization.  MATLAB excels at making nice looking plots easy.  When I "
"began working with EEG data, I found that I needed to write applications "
"to interact with my data, and developed an EEG analysis application in "
"MATLAB.  As the application grew in complexity, interacting with "
"databases, http servers, manipulating complex data structures, I began to"
" strain against the limitations of MATLAB as a programming language, and "
"decided to start over in Python.  Python more than makes up for all of "
"MATLAB's deficiencies as a programming language, but I was having "
"difficulty finding a 2D plotting package (for 3D `VTK "
"<http://www.vtk.org/>`_ more than exceeds all of my needs)."

"Finding no package that suited me just right, I did what any self-"
"respecting Python programmer would do: rolled up my sleeves and dived in."
"  Not having any real experience with computer graphics, I decided to "
"emulate MATLAB's plotting capabilities because that is something MATLAB "
"does very well.  This had the added advantage that many people have a lot"
" of MATLAB experience, and thus they can quickly get up to steam plotting"
" in python.  From a developer's perspective, having a fixed user "
"interface (the pylab interface) has been very useful, because the guts of"
" the code base can be redesigned without affecting user code."

"The Matplotlib code is conceptually divided into three parts: the *pylab "
"interface* is the set of functions provided by :mod:`pylab` which allow "
"the user to create plots with code quite similar to MATLAB figure "
"generating code (:doc:`/tutorials/introductory/pyplot`).  The *Matplotlib"
" frontend* or *Matplotlib API* is the set of classes that do the heavy "
"lifting, creating and managing figures, text, lines, plots and so on "
"(:doc:`/tutorials/intermediate/artists`).  This is an abstract interface "
"that knows nothing about output.  The *backends* are device-dependent "
"drawing devices, aka renderers, that transform the frontend "
"representation to hardcopy or a display device (:ref:`what-"
"is-a-backend`).  Example backends: PS creates `PostScriptÂ® "
"<https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript.html>`_ hardcopy, SVG creates "
"`Scalable Vector Graphics <https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/>`_ hardcopy, "
"Agg creates PNG output using the high quality `Anti-Grain Geometry "
"<http://agg.sourceforge.net/antigrain.com/>`_ library that ships with "
"Matplotlib, GTK embeds Matplotlib in a `Gtk+ <https://www.gtk.org/>`_ "
"application, GTKAgg uses the Anti-Grain renderer to create a figure and "
"embed it in a Gtk+ application, and so on for `PDF "
"<https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/about-adobe-pdf.html>`_, "
"`WxWidgets <https://www.wxpython.org/>`_, `Tkinter "

"Matplotlib is used by many people in many different contexts.  Some "
"people want to automatically generate PostScript files to send to a "
"printer or publishers.  Others deploy Matplotlib on a web application "
"server to generate PNG output for inclusion in dynamically-generated web "
"pages.  Some use Matplotlib interactively from the Python shell in "
"Tkinter on Windows. My primary use is to embed Matplotlib in a Gtk+ EEG "
"application that runs on Windows, Linux and Macintosh OS X."
