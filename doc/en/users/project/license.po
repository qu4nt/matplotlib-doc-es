"Matplotlib uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains "
"copyright over their contributions to Matplotlib. But, it is important to"
" note that these contributions are typically only changes to the "
"repositories. Thus, the Matplotlib source code, in its entirety, is not "
"the copyright of any single person or institution.  Instead, it is the "
"collective copyright of the entire Matplotlib Development Team.  If "
"individual contributors want to maintain a record of what "
"changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should "
"indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they "
"commit the change to one of the matplotlib repositories."
