"A long standing request is to support multiple calls to "
":func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.show`.  This has been difficult because it is "
"hard to get consistent behavior across operating systems, user interface "
"toolkits and versions.  Eric Firing has done a lot of work on "
"rationalizing show across backends, with the desired behavior to make "
"show raise all newly created figures and block execution until they are "
"closed.  Repeated calls to show should raise newly created figures since "
"the last call.  Eric has done a lot of testing on the user interface "
"toolkits and versions and platforms he has access to, but it is not "
"possible to test them all, so please report problems to the `mailing list"
" <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-users>`__ and `bug "
