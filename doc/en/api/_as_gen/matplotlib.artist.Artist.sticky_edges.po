"When performing autoscaling, if a data limit coincides with a value in "
"the corresponding sticky_edges list, then no margin will be added--the "
"view limit \"sticks\" to the edge. A typical use case is histograms, "
"where one usually expects no margin on the bottom edge (0) of the "
"histogram."

"Moreover, margin expansion \"bumps\" against sticky edges and cannot "
"cross them.  For example, if the upper data limit is 1.0, the upper view "
"limit computed by simple margin application is 1.2, but there is a sticky"
" edge at 1.1, then the actual upper view limit will be 1.1."
