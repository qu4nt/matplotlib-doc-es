"Be careful when using this function, the results will not update if the "
"artist window extent of the artist changes.  The extent can change due to"
" any changes in the transform stack, such as changing the axes limits, "
"the figure size, or the canvas used (as is done when saving a figure).  "
"This can lead to unexpected behavior where interactive figures will look "
"fine on the screen, but will save incorrectly."
