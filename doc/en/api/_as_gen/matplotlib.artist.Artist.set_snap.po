"Snapping aligns positions with the pixel grid, which results in clearer "
"images. For example, if a black line of 1px width was defined at a "
"position in between two pixels, the resulting image would contain the "
"interpolated value of that line in the pixel grid, which would be a grey "
"value on both adjacent pixel positions. In contrast, snapping will move "
"the line to the nearest integer pixel value, so that the resulting image "
"will really contain a 1px wide black line."
