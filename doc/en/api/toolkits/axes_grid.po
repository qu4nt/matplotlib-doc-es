"AxesGrid has been a part of matplotlib since v 0.99. Originally, the "
"toolkit used the *axes_grid* namespace. In more recent versions, the "
"toolkit has been split into *axes_grid1* and *axisartist*.  While "
"*axes_grid* is maintained for the backward compatibility, use of "
"*axes_grid1* and *axisartist* is recommended.  For the documentation on "
"``axes_grid``, see the `previous version of the docs`__."
