"Prior to 1.5.3 keyword arguments passed to `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot` "
"were handled in two parts -- default keyword arguments generated internal"
" to `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot` (such as the cycled styles) and user "
"supplied keyword arguments.  The internally generated keyword arguments "
"were passed to the `matplotlib.lines.Line2D` and the user keyword "
"arguments were passed to ``ln.set(**kwargs)`` to update the artist after "
"it was created.  Now both sets of keyword arguments are merged and passed"
" to `~matplotlib.lines.Line2D`.  This change was made to allow *None* to "
"be passed in via the user keyword arguments to mean 'do the default "
"thing' as is the convention through out Matplotlib rather than raising an"
" exception."

"Unlike most `~matplotlib.lines.Line2D` setter methods "
"`~matplotlib.lines.Line2D.set_marker` did accept `None` as a valid input "
"which was mapped to 'no marker'.  Thus, by routing this ``marker=None`` "
"through ``__init__`` rather than ``set(...)`` the meaning of "
"``ax.plot(..., marker=None)`` changed from 'no markers' to 'default "
"markers from rcparams'."

"This is change is only evident if ``mpl.rcParams['lines.marker']`` has a "
"value other than ``'None'`` (which is string ``'None'`` which means 'no "
"marker')."
