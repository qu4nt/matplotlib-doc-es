"pylab no longer provides a load and save function.  These are available "

"Axes instances no longer have a \"frame\" attribute. Instead, use the new"
" \"spines\" attribute. Spines is a dictionary where the keys are the "
"names of the spines (e.g., 'left','right' and so on) and the values are "
"the artists that draw the spines. For normal (rectilinear) axes, these "
"artists are Line2D instances. For other axes (such as polar axes), these "
"artists may be Patch instances."

"Polar plots no longer accept a resolution kwarg.  Instead, each Path must"
" specify its own number of interpolation steps.  This is unlikely to be a"
" user-visible change -- if interpolation of data is required, that should"
" be done before passing it to Matplotlib."
