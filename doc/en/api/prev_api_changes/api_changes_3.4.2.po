"Both `.FigureBase.subplot_mosaic`, and `.pyplot.subplot_mosaic` have had "
"the first position argument renamed from *layout* to *mosaic*.  This is "
"because we are considering to consolidate *constrained_layout* and "
"*tight_layout* keyword arguments in the Figure creation functions of "
"`.pyplot` into a single *layout* keyword argument which would collide."
