"`matplotlib.figure.Figure.legend` used to check if a line had the same "
"label as an existing legend entry. If it also had the same line color or "
"marker color legend didn't add a new entry for that line. However, the "
"list of conditions was incomplete, didn't handle RGB tuples, didn't "
"handle linewidths or linestyles etc."

"This logic did not exist in `.axes.Axes.legend`.  It was included "
"(erroneously) in Matplotlib 2.1.1 when the legend argument parsing was "
"unified [#9324](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9324).  "
"This change removes that check in `.axes.Axes.legend` again to restore "
"the old behavior."

"This logic has also been dropped from `.Figure.legend`, where it was "
"previously undocumented. Repeated lines with the same label will now each"
" have an entry in the legend.  If you do not want the duplicate entries, "
"don't add a label to the line, or prepend the label with an underscore."
