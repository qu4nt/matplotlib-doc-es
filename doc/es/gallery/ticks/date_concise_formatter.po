msgid "Finding good tick values and formatting the ticks for an axis that has date data is often a challenge.  `~.dates.ConciseDateFormatter` is meant to improve the strings chosen for the ticklabels, and to minimize the strings used in those tick labels as much as possible."

msgid "Dates formats can be localized if the default formats are not desirable by manipulating one of three lists of strings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../gallery/ticks/date_concise_formatter.rst:175
msgid "The ``formatter.formats`` list of formats is for the normal tick labels, There are six levels: years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds. The ``formatter.offset_formats`` is how the \"offset\" string on the right of the axis is formatted.  This is usually much more verbose than the tick labels. Finally, the ``formatter.zero_formats`` are the formats of the ticks that are \"zeros\".  These are tick values that are either the first of the year, month, or day of month, or the zeroth hour, minute, or second. These are usually the same as the format of the ticks a level above.  For example if the axis limits mean the ticks are mostly days, then we label 1 Mar 2005 simply with a \"Mar\".  If the axis limits are mostly hours, we label Feb 4 00:00 as simply \"Feb-4\"."
