msgid "This example plots horizontal histograms of different samples along a categorical x-axis. Additionally, the histograms are plotted to be symmetrical about their x-position, thus making them very similar to violin plots."

msgid "To make this highly specialized plot, we can't use the standard ``hist`` method. Instead we use ``barh`` to draw the horizontal bars directly. The vertical positions and lengths of the bars are computed via the ``np.histogram`` function. The histograms for all the samples are computed using the same range (min and max values) and number of bins, so that the bins for each sample are in the same vertical positions."
