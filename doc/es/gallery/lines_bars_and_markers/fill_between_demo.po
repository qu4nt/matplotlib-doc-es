msgid "`~.axes.Axes.fill_between` uses the colors of the color cycle as the fill color. These may be a bit strong when applied to fill areas. It is therefore often a good practice to lighten the color by making the area semi-transparent using *alpha*."

msgstr ""

#: ../../gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/fill_between_demo.rst:144
msgid "Only x-ranges of contiguous *True* sequences are filled. As a result the range between neighboring *True* and *False* values is never filled. This often undesired when the data points should represent a contiguous quantity. It is therefore recommended to set ``interpolate=True`` unless the x-distance of the data points is fine enough so that the above effect is not noticeable. Interpolation approximates the actual x position at which the *where* condition will change and extends the filling up to there."

#: ../../gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/fill_between_demo.rst:194
msgid "Similar gaps will occur if *y1* or *y2* are masked arrays. Since missing values cannot be approximated, *interpolate* has no effect in this case. The gaps around masked values can only be reduced by adding more data points close to the masked values."
