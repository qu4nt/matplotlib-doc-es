msgid "The `.inset_locator`'s `~.inset_locator.inset_axes` allows easily placing insets in the corners of the axes by specifying a width and height and optionally a location (loc) that accepts locations as codes, similar to `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.legend`. By default, the inset is offset by some points from the axes, controlled via the *borderpad* parameter."

#: ../../gallery/axes_grid1/inset_locator_demo.rst:83
msgid "The parameters *bbox_to_anchor* and *bbox_transform* can be used for a more fine grained control over the inset position and size or even to position the inset at completely arbitrary positions. The *bbox_to_anchor* sets the bounding box in coordinates according to the *bbox_transform*."

msgid "In the above the axes transform together with 4-tuple bounding boxes has been used as it mostly is useful to specify an inset relative to the axes it is an inset to. However other use cases are equally possible. The following example examines some of those."
