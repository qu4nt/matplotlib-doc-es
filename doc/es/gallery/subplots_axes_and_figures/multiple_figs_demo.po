msgid "`matplotlib.pyplot` uses the concept of a *current figure* and *current axes*. Figures are identified via a figure number that is passed to `~.pyplot.figure`. The figure with the given number is set as *current figure*. Additionally, if no figure with the number exists, a new one is created."

msgid "We discourage working with multiple figures in pyplot because managing the *current figure* is cumbersome and error-prone. Instead, we recommend to use the object-oriented approach and call methods on Figure and Axes instances."
