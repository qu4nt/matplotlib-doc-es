msgid "Contour plotting is particularly handy when illustrating the solution space of optimization problems.  Not only can `.axes.Axes.contour` be used to represent the topography of the objective function, it can be used to generate boundary curves of the constraint functions.  The constraint lines can be drawn with `~matplotlib.patheffects.TickedStroke` to distinguish the valid and invalid sides of the constraint boundaries."

msgid "`.axes.Axes.contour` generates curves with larger values to the left of the contour.  The angle parameter is measured zero ahead with increasing values to the left.  Consequently, when using `~matplotlib.patheffects.TickedStroke` to illustrate a constraint in a typical optimization problem, the angle should be set between zero and 180 degrees."
