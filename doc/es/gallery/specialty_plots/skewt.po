msgstr ""

#: ../../gallery/specialty_plots/skewt.rst:25
msgid "This serves as an intensive exercise of Matplotlib's transforms and custom projection API. This example produces a so-called SkewT-logP diagram, which is a common plot in meteorology for displaying vertical profiles of temperature. As far as Matplotlib is concerned, the complexity comes from having X and Y axes that are not orthogonal. This is handled by including a skew component to the basic Axes transforms. Additional complexity comes in handling the fact that the upper and lower X-axes have different data ranges, which necessitates a bunch of custom classes for ticks, spines, and axis to handle this."
