msgid "Note that the \"overlay\" and \"soft\" blend modes work well for complex surfaces such as this example, while the default \"hsv\" blend mode works best for smooth surfaces such as many mathematical functions."

msgid "In most cases, hillshading is used purely for visual purposes, and *dx*/*dy* can be safely ignored. In that case, you can tweak *vert_exag* (vertical exaggeration) by trial and error to give the desired visual effect. However, this example demonstrates how to use the *dx* and *dy* keyword arguments to ensure that the *vert_exag* parameter is the true vertical exaggeration."
