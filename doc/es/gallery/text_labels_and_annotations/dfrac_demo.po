msgid "In this example, the differences between the \\\\dfrac and \\\\frac TeX macros are illustrated; in particular, the difference between display style and text style fractions when using Mathtex."

msgid "To use \\\\dfrac with the LaTeX engine (text.usetex : True), you need to import the amsmath package with the text.latex.preamble rc, which is an unsupported feature; therefore, it is probably a better idea to just use the \\\\displaystyle option before the \\\\frac macro to get this behavior with the LaTeX engine."
