msgid "Arrows are often used to annotate plots. This tutorial shows how to plot arrows that behave differently when the data limits on a plot are changed. In general, points on a plot can either be fixed in \"data space\" or \"display space\". Something plotted in data space moves when the data limits are altered - an example would be the points in a scatter plot. Something plotted in display space stays static when data limits are altered - an example would be a figure title or the axis labels."
