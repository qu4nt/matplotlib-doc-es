msgstr ""

#: ../../gallery/mplot3d/stem3d_demo.rst:60
msgid "The position of the baseline can be adapted using *bottom*. The parameters *linefmt*, *markerfmt*, and *basefmt* control basic format properties of the plot. However, in contrast to `~.axes3d.Axes3D.plot` not all properties are configurable via keyword arguments. For more advanced control adapt the line objects returned by `.stem3D`."

msgid "For examples, by setting ``orientation='x'``, the stems are projected along the *x*-direction, and the baseline is in the *yz*-plane."
