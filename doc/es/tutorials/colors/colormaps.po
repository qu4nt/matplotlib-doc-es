msgid "Matplotlib has a number of built-in colormaps accessible via `.matplotlib.cm.get_cmap`.  There are also external libraries that have many extra colormaps, which can be viewed in the `Third-party colormaps`_ section of the Matplotlib documentation. Here we briefly discuss how to choose between the many options.  For help on creating your own colormaps, see :doc:`/tutorials/colors/colormap-manipulation`."

msgid "For many applications, a perceptually uniform colormap is the best choice; i.e. a colormap in which equal steps in data are perceived as equal steps in the color space. Researchers have found that the human brain perceives changes in the lightness parameter as changes in the data much better than, for example, changes in hue. Therefore, colormaps which have monotonically increasing lightness through the colormap will be better interpreted by the viewer. Wonderful examples of perceptually uniform colormaps can be found in the `Third-party colormaps`_ section as well."

msgid "Color can be represented in 3D space in various ways. One way to represent color is using CIELAB. In CIELAB, color space is represented by lightness, :math:`L^*`; red-green, :math:`a^*`; and yellow-blue, :math:`b^*`. The lightness parameter :math:`L^*` can then be used to learn more about how the matplotlib colormaps will be perceived by viewers."

Those that have a smaller range of :math:`L^*` will accordingly have a smaller perceptual range.

Others (afmhot, copper, gist_heat, and hot) have kinks in the :math:`L^*` functions. Data that is being represented in a region of the colormap that is at a plateau or kink will lead to a perception of banding of the data in those values in the colormap (see [mycarta-banding]_ for an excellent example of this)."

We are looking for approximately equal minimum :math:`L^*` values at opposite ends of the colormap. By these measures, BrBG and RdBu are good options. coolwarm is a good option, but it doesn't span a wide range of :math:`L^*` values (see grayscale section below)."

At the ends and middle, :math:`L^*` will reverse direction, which should be smoothed in :math:`L^*` space to reduce artifacts. See [kovesi-colormaps]_ for more information on the design of cyclic maps."

We would expect to see a divergence in these colormaps, then, but multiple kinks may not be ideal, such as in gist_earth and terrain. CMRmap was created to convert well to grayscale, though it does appear to have some small kinks in :math:`L^*`.  cubehelix was created to vary smoothly in both lightness and hue, but appears to have a small hump in the green hue area. turbo was created to display depth and disparity data."

#: ../../tutorials/colors/colormaps.rst:569
msgid "Conversion to grayscale is done in many different ways [bw]_. Some of the better ones use a linear combination of the rgb values of a pixel, but weighted according to how we perceive color intensity. A nonlinear method of conversion to grayscale is to use the :math:`L^*` values of the pixels. In general, similar principles apply for this question as they do for presenting one's information perceptually; that is, if a colormap is chosen that is monotonically increasing in :math:`L^*` values, it will print in a reasonable manner to grayscale."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/colors/colormaps.rst:578
msgid "With this in mind, we see that the Sequential colormaps have reasonable representations in grayscale. Some of the Sequential2 colormaps have decent enough grayscale representations, though some (autumn, spring, summer, winter) have very little grayscale change. If a colormap like this was used in a plot and then the plot was printed to grayscale, a lot of the information may map to the same gray values. The Diverging colormaps mostly vary from darker gray on the outer edges to white in the middle. Some (PuOr and seismic) have noticeably darker gray on one side than the other and therefore are not very symmetric. coolwarm has little range of gray scale and would print to a more uniform plot, losing a lot of detail. Note that overlaid, labeled contours could help differentiate between one side of the colormap vs. the other since color cannot be used once a plot is printed to grayscale. Many of the Qualitative and Miscellaneous colormaps, such as Accent, hsv, jet and turbo, change from darker to lighter and back to darker grey throughout the colormap. This would make it impossible for a viewer to interpret the information in a plot once it is printed in grayscale."
