msgid "Wrap all of the matplotlib getter and setter methods with python `properties <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property>`_, allowing them to be read and written like class attributes."

#: ../../devel/MEP/MEP13.rst:29
msgid "Currently matplotlib uses getter and setter functions (usually prefixed with get\\_ and set\\_, respectively) for reading and writing data related to classes.  However, since 2.6 python supports properties, which allow such setter and getter functions to be accessed as though they were attributes.  This proposal would implement all existing setter and getter methods as properties."

#: ../../devel/MEP/MEP13.rst:39
msgid "All existing getter and setter methods will need to have two aliases, one with the get\\_ or set\\_ prefix and one without. Getter methods that currently lack prefixes should be recording in a text file."

msgstr ""

#: ../../devel/MEP/MEP13.rst:45
msgid "Getter and setter methods the provide additional optional optional arguments should have those arguments accessible in another manner, either as additional getter or setter methods or attributes of other classes.  If those classes are not accessible, getters for them should be added."

msgid "Convert ``set_xlim``, ``set_xlabel``, ``set_title``, etc. to ``xlim``, ``xlabel``, ``title``,... to make the transition from ``plt`` functions to ``axes`` methods significantly simpler. These would still be methods, not properties, but it's still a great usability enhancement while retaining the interface."
