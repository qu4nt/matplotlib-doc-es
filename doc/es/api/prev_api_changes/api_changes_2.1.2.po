msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_2.1.2.rst:8
msgid "`matplotlib.figure.Figure.legend` used to check if a line had the same label as an existing legend entry. If it also had the same line color or marker color legend didn't add a new entry for that line. However, the list of conditions was incomplete, didn't handle RGB tuples, didn't handle linewidths or linestyles etc."

msgid "This logic did not exist in `.axes.Axes.legend`.  It was included (erroneously) in Matplotlib 2.1.1 when the legend argument parsing was unified [#9324](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9324).  This change removes that check in `.axes.Axes.legend` again to restore the old behavior."

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_2.1.2.rst:19
msgid "This logic has also been dropped from `.Figure.legend`, where it was previously undocumented. Repeated lines with the same label will now each have an entry in the legend.  If you do not want the duplicate entries, don't add a label to the line, or prepend the label with an underscore."
