msgid "Changes for 0.91.0"
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:5
msgid "Changed ``cbook.is_file_like`` to ``cbook.is_writable_file_like`` and corrected behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:8
msgid "Added *ax* keyword argument to :func:`.pyplot.colorbar` and :meth:`.Figure.colorbar` so that one can specify the axes object from which space for the colorbar is to be taken, if one does not want to make the colorbar axes manually."
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:13
msgid "Changed ``cbook.reversed`` so it yields a tuple rather than a (index, tuple). This agrees with the Python reversed builtin, and cbook only defines reversed if Python doesn't provide the builtin."
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:17
msgid "Made skiprows=1 the default on ``csv2rec``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:19
msgid "The gd and paint backends have been deleted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:21
msgid "The errorbar method and function now accept additional kwargs so that upper and lower limits can be indicated by capping the bar with a caret instead of a straight line segment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:25
msgid "The :mod:`matplotlib.dviread` file now has a parser for files like psfonts.map and pdftex.map, to map TeX font names to external files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:28
msgid "The file :mod:`matplotlib.type1font` contains a new class for Type 1 fonts.  Currently it simply reads pfa and pfb format files and stores the data in a way that is suitable for embedding in pdf files. In the future the class might actually parse the font to allow e.g.,  subsetting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:34
msgid ":mod:`matplotlib.ft2font` now supports ``FT_Attach_File``. In practice this can be used to read an afm file in addition to a pfa/pfb file, to get metrics and kerning information for a Type 1 font."
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:39
msgid "The :class:`.AFM` class now supports querying CapHeight and stem widths. The get_name_char method now has an isord kwarg like get_width_char."
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:43
msgid "Changed :func:`.pcolor` default to ``shading='flat'``; but as noted now in the docstring, it is preferable to simply use the *edgecolor* keyword argument."
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:47
msgid "The mathtext font commands (``\\cal``, ``\\rm``, ``\\it``, ``\\tt``) now behave as TeX does: they are in effect until the next font change command or the end of the grouping.  Therefore uses of ``$\\cal{R}$`` should be changed to ``${\\cal R}$``.  Alternatively, you may use the new LaTeX-style font commands (``\\mathcal``, ``\\mathrm``, ``\\mathit``, ``\\mathtt``) which do affect the following group, e.g., ``$\\mathcal{R}$``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:55
msgid "Text creation commands have a new default linespacing and a new ``linespacing`` kwarg, which is a multiple of the maximum vertical extent of a line of ordinary text.  The default is 1.2; ``linespacing=2`` would be like ordinary double spacing, for example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:60
msgid "Changed default kwarg in `matplotlib.colors.Normalize` to ``clip=False``; clipping silently defeats the purpose of the special over, under, and bad values in the colormap, thereby leading to unexpected behavior.  The new default should reduce such surprises."
msgstr ""

#: ../../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_0.91.0.rst:65
msgid "Made the emit property of :meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_xlim` and :meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_ylim` ``True`` by default; removed the Axes custom callback handling into a 'callbacks' attribute which is a :class:`~matplotlib.cbook.CallbackRegistry` instance.  This now supports the 'xlim_changed' and 'ylim_changed' Axes events."
