msgid "Prior to 1.5.3 keyword arguments passed to `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot` were handled in two parts -- default keyword arguments generated internal to `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot` (such as the cycled styles) and user supplied keyword arguments.  The internally generated keyword arguments were passed to the `matplotlib.lines.Line2D` and the user keyword arguments were passed to ``ln.set(**kwargs)`` to update the artist after it was created.  Now both sets of keyword arguments are merged and passed to `~matplotlib.lines.Line2D`.  This change was made to allow *None* to be passed in via the user keyword arguments to mean 'do the default thing' as is the convention through out Matplotlib rather than raising an exception."

msgid "Unlike most `~matplotlib.lines.Line2D` setter methods `~matplotlib.lines.Line2D.set_marker` did accept `None` as a valid input which was mapped to 'no marker'.  Thus, by routing this ``marker=None`` through ``__init__`` rather than ``set(...)`` the meaning of ``ax.plot(..., marker=None)`` changed from 'no markers' to 'default markers from rcparams'."
