Now *fontproperties* (which is what is really used to set the font properties of `.AnchoredSizeBar`) is passed through in place of *prop*.

msgid "The use of the index 0 in `.pyplot.subplot` and related commands is deprecated.  Due to a lack of validation, calling ``plt.subplots(2, 2, 0)`` does not raise an exception, but puts an axes in the _last_ position.  This is due to the indexing in subplot being 1-based (to mirror MATLAB) so before indexing into the `.GridSpec` object used to determine where the axes should go, 1 is subtracted off.  Passing in 0 results in passing -1 to `.GridSpec` which results in getting the last position back.  Even though this behavior is clearly wrong and not intended, we are going through a deprecation cycle in an abundance of caution that any users are exploiting this 'feature'. The use of 0 as an index will raise a warning in 1.4 and an exception in 1.5."
