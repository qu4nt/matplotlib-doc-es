msgid "Matplotlib works with a number of user interface toolkits (wxpython, tkinter, qt, gtk, and macosx) and in order to support features like interactive panning and zooming of figures, it is helpful to the developers to have an API for interacting with the figure via key presses and mouse movements that is \"GUI neutral\" so we don't have to repeat a lot of code across the different user interfaces.  Although the event handling API is GUI neutral, it is based on the GTK model, which was the first user interface Matplotlib supported.  The events that are triggered are also a bit richer vis-a-vis Matplotlib than standard GUI events, including information like which `~.axes.Axes` the event occurred in.  The events also understand the Matplotlib coordinate system, and report event locations in both pixel and data coordinates."
