msgstr ""

#: ../../users/prev_whats_new/whats_new_3.0.rst:19
msgid "Two new colormaps named 'twilight' and 'twilight_shifted' have been added.  These colormaps start and end on the same color, and have two symmetric halves with equal lightness, but diverging color. Since they wrap around, they are a good choice for cyclic data such as phase angles, compass directions, or time of day. Like *viridis* and *cividis*, *twilight* is perceptually uniform and colorblind friendly."

msgstr ""

#: ../../users/prev_whats_new/whats_new_3.0.rst:38
msgid "The behavior of ``scilimits=(0, 0)`` is unchanged. With this setting, Matplotlib will adjust the order of magnitude depending on the axis values, rather than keeping it fixed. Previously, setting ``scilimits=(m, m)`` was equivalent to setting ``scilimits=(0, 0)``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../users/prev_whats_new/whats_new_3.0.rst:46
msgid "A new mpl_toolkits class :class:`~mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.anchored_artists.AnchoredDirectionArrows` draws a pair of orthogonal arrows to indicate directions on a 2D plot. A minimal working example takes in the transformation object for the coordinate system (typically ax.transAxes), and arrow labels. There are several optional parameters that can be used to alter layout. For example, the arrow pairs can be rotated and the color can be changed. By default the labels and arrows have the same color, but the class may also pass arguments for customizing arrow and text layout, these are passed to :class:`matplotlib.textpath.TextPath` and `matplotlib.patches.FancyArrowPatch`. Location, length and width for both arrow tail and head can be adjusted, the direction arrows and labels can have a frame. Padding and separation parameters can be adjusted."

msgstr ""

#: ../../users/prev_whats_new/whats_new_3.0.rst:63
msgid "A new method ``ColorbarBase.minorticks_on`` has been added to correctly display minor ticks on a colorbar. This method doesn't allow the minor ticks to extend into the regions beyond vmin and vmax when the *extend* keyword argument (used while creating the colorbar) is set to 'both', 'max' or 'min'. A complementary method ``ColorbarBase.minorticks_off`` has also been added to remove the minor ticks on the colorbar."

msgid "The number of ticks placed on colorbars was previously appropriate for a large colorbar, but looked bad if the colorbar was made smaller (i.e. via the *shrink* keyword argument). This has been changed so that the number of ticks is now responsive to how large the colorbar is."

msgstr ""

#: ../../users/prev_whats_new/whats_new_3.0.rst:84
msgid "Previously, when saving a figure to a file using the GUI's save dialog box, if the default filename (based on the figure window title) already existed on disk, Matplotlib would append a suffix (e.g. ``Figure_1-1.png``), preventing the dialog from prompting to overwrite the file. This behaviour has been removed. Now if the file name exists on disk, the user is prompted whether or not to overwrite it. This eliminates guesswork, and allows intentional overwriting, especially when the figure name has been manually set using ``figure.canvas.set_window_title()``."

Both default to ``None``, which means the legend title will have the same font size as the axes default font size (*not* the legend font size, set by the *fontsize* keyword argument or :rc:`legend.fontsize`)."

msgid "We acknowledge that the majority of people do not like egg-shaped pies. Therefore, an axes to which a pie chart is plotted will be set to have equal aspect ratio by default. This ensures that the pie appears circular independent on the axes size or units. To revert to the previous behaviour set the axes' aspect ratio to automatic by using ``ax.set_aspect(\"auto\")`` or ``plt.axis(\"auto\")``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../users/prev_whats_new/whats_new_3.0.rst:175
msgid "If desired, the title can still be placed manually.  There is a slight kludge; the algorithm checks if the y-position of the title is 1.0 (the default), and moves if it is.  If the user places the title in the default location (i.e. ``ax.title.set_position(0.5, 1.0)``), the title will still be moved above the xaxis.  If the user wants to avoid this, they can specify a number that is close (i.e. ``ax.title.set_position(0.5, 1.01)``) and the title will not be moved via this algorithm."
